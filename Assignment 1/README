OverView
******************************************

The Program is simply a replica of find "FileName".
The program opens the directory using opendir and for every subdirectory that
is not a . directory(Hidden directory or directory beginning with .) it
creates a child process using fork which then open that sub directory and
using a pipe it writes every file name that is not a . directory or file
using the system call write. Which then thhe parent using read will store
that information within a binary search tree and finally it will print out
the filenames in alphabetical order and the free.

*************************************
FILE PURPOSE
*************************************

*************************************
MYFIND.c

	Myfind.c is the main file in which most of the
	opendir,readdir,forking,piping,storing are done

*************************************
Tree.H
	The Header files for Tree.c which contains the prototypes and header
	guards
*************************************
Tree.c
	This is the C file which has the function to create,parse,print and
	free the binary search tree.
	It contains the following Methods
	make_node: which create a node and returns the node

	insert_node: which inserts a node into your created node from	make_node

	parse: parse a string with the delmintor / and then appending it to
	the node

	print_tree: prints the node information within the tree in alphabetical ordering

	delete_tree: delete each node within the tree



***********************************************************
BUGS/Challanges
***********************************************************
There still seems to be memory leak however i am not sure whether it is within
the Node or is there something in main that i haven't freed

There seems to be 2 more directories called Dir2 & Dir3 that was created in
/tmp/360test i am not sure if this is intentional howver my program did store
it and print it. These two directory were created on the same day as the due
date

I had a bit over challanges with reading and writing through pipes especially
when i didn't flush with memset on the strings so there was left over data.

I spend 12 Hours finding out why i wasn't reading subdirectories and finally
after careful research i determined that i wasn't actually getting the
fullpath thus i had to append the argv[1] with the / directory name.

For the coding style for camelcases i do not know if we should use camelcase or not
because it wasn't clearly specific so i originally did it in camelcase but then i made the functions
with like print_tree instead of printTree.

I also got help from these websites to help me with function calls and
creating the binary search tree.

Special Thanks
*************************************************
I would like to thank a few of the Cmpt360 ppl who has contributed toward my assignment
such as Daniel for tell me to use strcmp instead of having a key value for the binary search tree.

I would like to thank Dillan( i forgot his last name) for helping me debug the read and write pipes problem.

I would like to thank the professor for helping me when i am stuck.
